This is the Python (Flask) rewrite of a project I originally did with Node.js. You can check the original project at [GitHub](https://github.com/moraesvic/davinci) (although you probably shouldn't, this Python version is better written and better tested).

My intention here is to rewrite the back-end in Python, creating automated tests that guarantee that the new API produces the same output as the old one. Improving the front-end is also a possibility, if I have enough time.
